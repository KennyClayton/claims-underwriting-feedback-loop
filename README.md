# Underwriting Insights System

## Mission Statement

A property insurance system that creates a feedback loop between claims data and underwriting decisions, enabling data-driven risk assessment and reducing loss ratios through intelligent risk scoring.

## Problem Statement

Current property insurance systems operate with underwriting and claims departments in silos. Underwriters make risk decisions based on static guidelines and limited historical context, while valuable claims data that could inform better underwriting decisions remains isolated in separate systems. This disconnect leads to:

- Inconsistent risk assessment
- Missed warning signs on high-risk properties
- No feedback mechanism to learn from past underwriting decisions
- Higher-than-necessary loss ratios
- Reactive rather than proactive risk management

## Solution Overview

The Underwriting Insights System bridges the gap between claims history and underwriting decisions by:

1. **Real-Time Risk Scoring** - Automatically calculating risk scores based on property characteristics and historical claims data
2. **Intelligent Alerts** - Flagging high-risk indicators during the quote process
3. **Data-Driven Dashboards** - Providing underwriters with claims history for similar properties
4. **Feedback Loop** - Feeding claims data back into the risk model to continuously improve accuracy
5. **Performance Tracking** - Measuring underwriting decision quality against actual claim outcomes

## System Architecture

### Use Case Diagrams

**Current State:** Disconnected systems where underwriting and claims operate independently

**Future State:** Integrated system with real-time risk scoring engine connecting all stakeholders

### Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

The system tracks relationships between:
- Customers and their properties
- Properties and their insurance policies
- Policies and their risk scores
- Claims and the risk factors they identify
- Historical patterns that inform future decisions

**Core Entities:**
- Customer
- Property
- Policy
- Claim
- Risk Score
- Risk Factor
- Underwriter
- Agent

### Technology Stack

- **Backend:** .NET Core 8.0 / C#
- **Database:** SQL Server
- **ORM:** Entity Framework Core
- **API:** RESTful Web API
- **Architecture:** Clean Architecture with separation of concerns

## Key Features

### For Insurance Agents
- Submit applications with instant risk feedback
- View real-time risk scores and alerts
- Generate risk-adjusted quotes automatically

### For Underwriters
- Access comprehensive risk dashboards
- Review claims history for similar properties
- Make data-driven approval decisions
- Track underwriting performance metrics

### For Claims Adjusters
- Record claims that automatically feed into risk scoring
- Identify risk factors during claim processing

### Risk Scoring Engine
- Analyzes property characteristics (roof age, construction type, location)
- Incorporates historical claims patterns
- Calculates predicted loss ratios
- Provides risk level classifications (Low, Medium, High)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- .NET 8.0 SDK
- SQL Server 2019 or later
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code

### Installation

1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[your-username]/underwriting-insights.git
cd underwriting-insights
```

2. Set up the database
```bash
